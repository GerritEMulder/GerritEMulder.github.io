            <p> After university I took a job as a Front-End Web Developer.<br><br>
                <!-- Maybe remove this line ^ -->
                ​I managed several websites, the main one being for the National Professional Association for Health Information Industry in Canada.  
                The website processes an annual revenue of over $2,000,000 and has almost 5,500 members across Canada. I keep plugins updated, fix bugs, and modify plugins to fit unique use cases.  
                I mainly use PHP & HTML in WordPress 6.0 to build new features and fix old ones with a little bit of Javascript when needed.  
                ​The largest project I have worked on was to overhaul a subscription system which included, editing a large number of existing pages, creating custom logic to add a dynamic fee to the subscription, and customizing the user interface for the owner and managers of the team.
                
                I have linked the main website I manage below for those who are interested.
