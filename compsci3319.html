            <p> This is a website I built for the class "An Introduction to Databases" (CS3319) I took at Western University. <br><br>
                <!-- Maybe remove this line ^ -->
                This website was built using PHP, CSS, Javascript, HTML, and MySQL.<br>
                The goal of this project was to create a health network website that allows someone to update the doctors, hospitals, patients and treats (which doctor is treating which patient) tables.<br><br>
                The follow is a list of features that health websites has:<br>
                - Lists all the doctor's first name and last name in alphabetical order by last name or by first name. <br>
                - Allows the user to decide if the doctors name (either first or last) should be in ascending or descending order.<br>
                - Once the list of doctors is displayed, allows the user to select one of the doctors and then display all of this doctor's information.<br>
                - Lists all the doctors who were licensed before a given date.<br>
                - Allows the user to enter a new doctor.<br>
                - Allows the user to delete an existing doctor.<br>
                - Allows the user to update a hospital's name.<br>
                - Lists all the hospital names and the first name and last name of the head doctor of each hospital and the doctor's start date as head, in alphabetical order by hospital name.<br>
                - Allows the user to select a patient (by entering their OHIP number) and then outputs that patient's first and last name and the name of the doctor(s) who treat that patient.<br>
                - Allows the user to assign a doctor to treat a patient.<br>
                - Outputs the first and last name of any doctor who has no patients.<br>
