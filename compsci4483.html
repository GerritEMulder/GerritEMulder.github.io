            <p> This is a game that I helped create and develop for a game development class at Western University. <br><br>
                <!-- Maybe remove this line ^ -->
                This a group project that I collaborated on with four other people.<br>
                This game was built using Unity and C#.<br><br>

                The Paper Curse is a challenging two-dimensional platformer where you, Isaac, a paper man and the protagonist of this game, struggle in search of a way to break the curse placed on you. 
                You want to become human and live a normal life. Your journey will not be an easy oneâ€¦ a single mistake could set you back.
